|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Not sure if cryptography is your thing?                                   | Start with the [introductory beginner series](/beginner/intro.md) of challenges, they're a short series of 4 challenges that go from nothing to solving some real cryptography challenges |
| Wanting to learn more about cryptography?                                 | Work on cryptopals and follow the [companion guide](/cryptopals/intro.md)!
| Done both and looking for more?                                           | Take a look at [cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org/) for more challenges that cover additional topics like elliptical curves
| Want more low level systems-like cryptography?                            | Take a look at [Block Breakers](https://www.davidwong.fr/blockbreakers/index.html) for a guided series on attacking block ciphers themselves 
| Prefer lecture style lessons instead of getting hands on with challenges? | [RPISEC](https://www.youtube.com/c/RPISEC_talks/videos) has a bunch of streamed lectures covering a number of cryptography concepts. (If anyone has any textbook recommendations feel free to open a PR on [the repo](https://github.com/ubcctf/crypto-mdbook)) |
| Interested in building out your cryptography toolkit?                     | Check out some of the [assorted challenges](/assorted/intro.md) |
| Want to test your skills against a set of beginner/intermediate challenges? | Try out [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/), an excellent beginner CTF put on by CMU |
| Built up a foundation with cryptohack/cryptopals?                         | Dive straight into CTFs! Check out [ctftime](https://ctftime.org/) to get a list of upcoming events |

## About

The Cryptographer's Codex is primarily consisted of challenges and documents written up by [Arctic](https://github.com/rctcwyvrn) of [Maple Bacon](https://maplebacon.org/)

The codex was an idea that I had when we (Maple Bacon) first hosted our beginner CTF for UBC students, SaplingCTF. The name was catchy so it stuck around and over time I built up more and more stuff that I had written up for various things so I thought I should just collect them together under site.

The end goal with the site is to have a place for us cryptographers to point interested CTF players towards, with a curated set of challenges, guides, and setup resources.
