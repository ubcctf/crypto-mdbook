| Q | A |
|---|---|
| Not sure if cryptography is your thing? | Start with the [introductory beginner series](/beginner/intro.md) of challenges, they're a short series of 4 challenges that go from nothing to solving some real cryptography challenges |
| Wanting to learn more about cryptography? | Work on cryptopals and follow the [companion guide](/cryptopals/intro.md)!
| Done both and looking for more? | Take a look at [cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org/) for more challenges that cover additional topics like elliptical curves
| Want more low level systems-like cryptography? | Take a look at [Block Breakers](https://www.davidwong.fr/blockbreakers/index.html) for a guided series on attacking block ciphers themselves
